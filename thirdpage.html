	<h1 style="color: antiquewhite"> Introduction to AI</h1>
	<h2 style="color: antiquewhite">From G7.3 Kobe xiao</h2>
	<p style="color: antiquewhite">AI stands for Artifitial Intelligence, according to IBM.com, " It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs."</p>
	<p style="color: antiquewhite">The whole AI group is divided into two parts: weak AI and strong AI.</p>
	<p style="color: antiquewhite">Weak AI is AI trained and focused to perform specific tasks. Nowdays weak AI drives most of the systems that surrounds us.</p>
	<p style="color: antiquewhite">Strong AI is different from weak AI, according to IBM.com, "Strong AI is a theoretical form of AI where a machine would have an intelligence equaled to humans; it would have a self-aware consciousness that has the ability to solve problems, learn, and plan for the future."</p>
	<p style="color: antiquewhite">Until now, create a strong AI is still a impossible task, but we have AI that are close to strong AI now, for example ChatGPT and other "thinkable" AI made by Open AI.</p>
<p>Thank you, and hope we can have a better future.</p>
