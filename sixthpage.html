	<h1>How to edit my AI paintings</h1>
	<h2>From G7.3 Kobe xiao</h2>
	<p>I used the website that our teacher gave us, which is https://dream.ai/, to generate pictures. Then I used https://www.canva.com/en_gb/ to help me create a logo. Lastly, I put two AI-generated pictures with my logo together using Adobe Photoshop to create two complete paintings.</p>
	<p>This is picture one</p>
	<img src="photowithlogo1.png" width="430" height="680" alt=""/>
	<p>About the first picture, I chose the style of poster art and typed the prompt of “Planet, high detailed, light background, masterpiece” because I want a nice poster about celestial objects. Then I used Canva to create my own logo (at the bottom left corner) for showing my uniqueness, it was named as “Uncle Studio”. </p>
	<img src="photowithlogo2.png" width="430" height="680" alt=""/>
	<p>About the second picture, I also chose the poster art style and typed in “Deep forest, dark background, masterpiece” because I want a interesting picture with maybe some deers traveling in the mystic bushes. Then I paste my logo to put them together (also in the same position as the first picture).</p>
