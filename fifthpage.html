	<p>I will put the story here</p>
	<p>Deep within the kingdom of Hyrule, an ancient legend tells of a young hero who would rise up to defeat evil and restore peace to the land. This hero was known as Link, and his journey began with a fateful encounter in the village of Kokiri. Link was just a boy, not yet aware of his destiny, when he met a mysterious fairy named Navi. She led him to the Great Deku Tree, who told him of a terrible curse that had befallen the land. The evil sorcerer Ganondorf had stolen the Triforce, a sacred relic that granted its wielder immense power, and had plunged Hyrule into darkness. To break the curse, Link must seek out three spiritual stones and use them to open the way to the Sacred Realm, where the Triforce resides. Along the way, he must face countless dangers and challenges, from treacherous dungeons to fearsome monsters. Link first journeyed to the domain of the Zora people, where he obtained the mystical Zora Sapphire. He then ventured to the Goron city atop Death Mountain, where he battled the fiery dragon Volvagia and won the Goron Ruby.Finally, Link made his way to the desert wasteland of Gerudo Valley, where he infiltrated the fortress stronghold of Ganondorf's all-female army. There he found the last spiritual stone he needed, the Kokiri Emerald, guarded by the powerful sorceress Twinrova.With the three spiritual stones in hand, Link traveled to the Temple of Time, a sacred site deep within the forest. There he used the Ocarina of Time, a magical instrument given to him by Princess Zelda, to open the way to the Sacred Realm.But when Link reached the Triforce, he found that Ganondorf had already arrived. The two engaged in a fierce battle, with Link wielding the Master Sword, the only weapon capable of defeating the evil sorcerer.In the end, it was Link who emerged victorious, using the power of the Triforce to seal Ganondorf away forever. And with that, the curse was broken, and Hyrule was once again at peace. Link returned to his village a hero, forever remembered as the one who saved the land from darkness. And though his journey had been long and perilous, he knew that his adventures were far from over. For wherever there was evil in the land of Hyrule, there would always be a hero to rise up against it, and that hero would always be Link. </p>
	<p>My analysis: I think it is a preety good story generated by AI, from my knowledge of The Legend of Zelda, I know it have been researched a lot in oreder to create this, but I think it still need a lot of details in the text for description, for example the battle scene or the setting, and I think it can have dialogue to push the plot.</p>
